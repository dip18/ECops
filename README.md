# ECops

The aim of the project is to develop an online crime reporting and management system which is easily accessible to the public, the police department. The normal public in India is afraid to lodge a complaint because they are filled with a false fear about the police department. An online complaint registering system will allay the fears of the public and will also help in the public helping the police department in catching criminals.
The project e-COPS helps all the citizens to launch complain easily through Internet at any time. It also helps the police as the system becomes computerized. It will help the citizens as well as police. The other features of this online solution are enquiry about a complaint which has been registered before, the status of the complaint and other information
On the whole, the online crime registering and maintenance solution is an excellent method, which bridges the gap between the public and the police department.
